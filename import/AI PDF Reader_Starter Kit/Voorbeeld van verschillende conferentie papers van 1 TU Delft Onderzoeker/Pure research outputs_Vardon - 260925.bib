This paper introduces a novel experimental device for visualising fluid-driven cracks in clays. The device allows for the induction and observation of two-dimensional cracks in clay-rich, low-permeability materials through the injection of gas or water. The experimental setup comprises precision instrumentation for measuring compression forces, displacement, and fluid pressure, along with high-resolution imaging capabilities. Preliminary tests with Helium gas injection into Boom clay samples demonstrate the device's ability to track fracture evolution. This innovative experimental tool offers insights into the mechanisms governing fluid-driven fractures in clay-rich materials and provides a means to validate numerical models.",  author   = "J.

@conference{4f884ae9fbd141298bf90efe67776a3c,  title    = "Influence of spatial variability of shear strength parameters on reliability-based assessment of dykes",  abstract = "The Dutch dyke network includes 14,000 km of regional dykes that are regularly assessed in order to reduce the risk of flooding. The current strategy for maintenance and/or upgrading of existing dykes is based on safety assessments using partial factors and reliability-based characteristic values of material properties, interpreted from Eurocode 7 (EC7). In this paper, an historic dyke in the Netherlands has been analysed for stability using two methods: (a) based only on the point statistics of the material properties, as is widely adopted in Dutch practice based on a simplified interpretation of EC7, and (b) based on both the point and spatial statistics of the material properties, using a probabilistic approach in line with the full requirements of EC7. The results of safety assessments by the two methods show that a consideration of the spatial variability leads to a narrower range of possible responses, and thereby to a higher computed factor of safety at the target reliability of 95%. Moreover, for the dyke section considered, it results in much reduced remedial action compared to that suggested as a consequence of using the simplified approach, and thereby to a more economic design and reduced environmental impact.",  author   = "Divya Varkey and Hicks, {Michael A.} and Vardon, {Philip J.} and {van den Eijnden}, {Abraham P.}",  year     = "2019",  language = "English",  pages    = "153--160",  note     = "27th European Young Geotechnical Engineers Conference, eygec2019 ; Conference date: 26-09-2019 Through 27-09-2019",  url      = "https://www.geoengineer.org/events/824-27th-eygec, https://www.issmge.org/events/27th-eygec", }
